    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was lucky enough to get funding this year from Clojurists together to work on some open source projects for the Clojure community. It's been a really fun couple of months getting more involved in the ecosystem and having the time to work on some projects that I've long thought would be valuable for the community. This post is a summary of the things I've been working on over the past two months.</p><h2 id="sponsors">Sponsors</h2><p>First of all, I want to thank the sponsors that make this work possible. We're living through the worst tech job market since I started working as a software engineer, and I'm lucky to have a little bit of time and runway to work on things I find interesting thanks to the generous sponsors who find my work worthwhile.</p><p>Right now my work is primarily funded by <a href='https://www.clojuriststogether.org'>Clojurists Together</a> and <a href='https://www.cognitect.com'>Cognitect/Nubank</a>. Thank you to these major sponsors, and to everyone who contributes to my continued work in the Clojure open source ecosystem.</p><p>If you find the work I do valuable, please share it with others or consider supporting it financially. I would love to be able to turn working on this kind of stuff into a sustainable career in the long term.</p><h2 id="clojure&#95;tidy&#95;tuesdays">Clojure Tidy Tuesdays</h2><p>The main thing I spent my time working on over the past couple of months was a collection of tutorials and guides for working with data in Clojure. The R for Data Science online learning community publishes toy datasets every week for "Tidy Tuesdays" with a question to answer or example article to reproduce. I've been going through them in Clojure, and it's proven a great tool for uncovering areas for future development in the Clojure data science ecosystem.</p><h2 id="other&#95;work">Other Work</h2><p>The explorations with the Tidy Tuesday data have been revealing areas where I think we could benefit from more ergonomic ways to work with tablecloth datasets. I started two little projects each with a couple of little wrappers around existing functions to make them easier to use with tablecloth datasets. So far I'm calling them <code>tcstats</code> (for statistical operations on datasets) and <code>tcutils</code> (with miscellaneous dataset manipulation tools that aren't built-in to tablecloth directly).</p><p>I am also still working on the Clojure Data Cookbook. I nudged it forward ever so slightly these last couple of months, and I plan to finish it despite the remaining holes in Clojure's data science stack. I would love to also fill these in eventually, but the Cookbook will be a living document that can easily evolve and be updated as new tools and libraries are developed.</p><p>Lastly, one of the main missing pieces I'm discovering we really need to work on in Clojure's data science ecosystem is a robust yet flexible graphics library. There are a few great solutions that already exist, but they take different approaches to graphing that can make them a bit clumsy to work with when it comes time to build more complex visualisations. My dream is to implement a proper <a href='https://ggplot2-book.org'>grammar of graphics</a> in Clojure, giving the Clojure data ecosystem a "profressional quality" graphics library, so to speak. Anyway.. there is still tons of work to do here so I'm grateful for the ongoing funding that will allow me to continue to focus a large amount of time on it for the foreseeable future.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Clojure Tidy Tuesdays</title>
    <updated>2024-01-12T23:59:59+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I'm going to spend my new-found independent software development time on this year is doing TidyTuesdays in Clojure. It's no surprise that I'm a big fan of Clojure, or that I think there is a lack of good "how to do data science with Clojure" content out there. One of the big things I want to accomplish this year is filling this gap.</p><p>To that end, I'll be publishing "translations" of the data-fetching scripts into Clojure and implementations of example data analysis from <a href='https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master'>TidyTuesdays</a>, an initiative of the R for data science online learning community.</p><p>The idea is that they post a toy dataset each week along with an example article that uses the same or similar data, and then the community posts their solutions and what they did with it around the internet.</p><p>I'll be sharing mine in <a href='https://github.com/kiramclean/clojure-tidy-tuesdays/tree/main'>this Clojure Tidy Tuesdays github repo</a> and posting on <a href='https://indieweb.social/@kira'>Mastodon</a> and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/kiramclean/'>LinkedIn</a>.

    <title>A Year of Open Source</title>
    <updated>2024-01-02T23:59:59+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's a new year! I always feel so ambitious at the start of a new year. This one especially, though. I got a very exciting early Christmas present this year.</p><p><img src="/assets/2024-01-02-clj-together-message.jpg" alt="Daniel's very exciting message!" /></p><p>Of course I happily accepted this super exciting opportunity. Ever since I started dabbling software nearly 10 years ago now my dream was to eventually someday, somehow, make a living on my own terms. I quickly learned that I am not cut out for tech startups, but there are lots of other ways to make a living in software. I'm not sure I'm cut out for those either, but the way I see it this year is my chance to finally find out.</p><p>I'm mostly optimistic. I definitely have tons of ideas for things to work on, and I have a ton of motivation to make this work. How amazing would it be to actually be able to make a sustainable living working on things that I find interesting and that benefit my community? I'm planning on giving myself this year to make it work, and if I have to I'll find a real job again next year. I hope I don't have to.</p><p>I'll be working on open source projects using Clojure, mostly focusing on data-related stuff. I have a long running project writing a book about doing data stuff in Clojure that I plan to spend a lot more time on this year. It turns out writing a book is <i>so much</i> work, way more than I thought at first, but I'm never giving up and I will finish it no matter how long it takes. I also have a million small ideas for polishing things around the clojure data ecosystem that I think would help make it feel more ergonomic for "data people". I'd love to build on some of the tools out there for combining data libraries, tidyverse style. There's also a lack of guides and courses for learning how to use the emerging "default" stack for data science in Clojure. I think I can help in all these areas.</p><p>I think it'll take some discipline and re-wiring of my brain to be successful, but I think I can do it. I'm so used to being given projects to do for other people and squeezing in my side projects around my working hours. What will it look like when my side projects become my main focus during full-time working hours?</p><p>I'll need to learn how to prioritize things without much external influence or direction. Case in point &ndash; I spent over an hour faffing with the styles for this blog. On one hand, I care more than I should about aesthetics and at the end of the day do believe that function should take priority. On the other hand, it's done now and I have a blog I like looking at!</p><p>Anyway I made this website to separate my work in programming from my other pursuits, like yoga and violin. My plan is to post periodic updates and other tech-related posts here. If there's anything you would like to see contributed to the Clojure ecosystem, let me know! I'm always open to suggestions and ideas and especially early on this year I would love to hear from the people who voted for me to receive this funding.</p><p>Wish me luck!</p>]]></content>
