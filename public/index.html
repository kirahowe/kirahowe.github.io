        <h1><a href="2024-08-31-clojurists-together-update-jul-aug-2024.html">OSS Updates July and August 2024</a></h1>
        <p>This is a summary of the open source work I've spent my time on throughout July and August, 2024. There was a blog post, some library updates, and lots of community work.</p><h2 id="sponsors">Sponsors</h2><p>This work is made possible by the generous ongoing support of my sponsors. I appreciate all of the support the community has given to my work and would like to give a special thanks to Clojurists Together and Nubank for providing me with lucrative enough grants that I can reduce my client work significantly and afford to spend more time on these projects.</p><p>If you find my work valuable, please share it with others and consider supporting it financially. There are details about how to do that on my <a href='https://github.com/sponsors/kiramclean'>GitHub sponsors page</a>. On to the updates!</p><h2 id="blog&#95;post">Blog post</h2><p>At the beginning of the summer Daniel Slutsky and I were feeling very ambitious and thought we might be able to put together a course for data scientists coming to Clojure from other languages. For many reasons, this hasn't materialized yet, but in service of these plans I wrote a <a href='https://codewithkira.com/2024-07-18-tablecloth-dplyr-pandas-polars.html'>blog post comparing tablecloth</a> to other common data processing tools, like <code>dplyr</code>, <code>pandas</code>, and <code>polars</code>. My goal was to put tablecloth in perspective, illustrating some of the key differences between it and other standard, more popular, data processing tools.</p><h2 id="<code>tcutils</code>"><code>tcutils</code></h2><p>I added a few more helpers to <code>tcutils</code>, like <code>between</code> and <code>duplicate-rows</code>, and also made a <a href='https://scicloj.github.io/tcutils/'>docs website</a> for the project. I also had many interesting conversations with people in the community about how Clojure's data processing tools "feel" to work with, and how we might adopt APIs and conventions that are familiar to data scientists in the interest of making their transition to Clojure's ecosystem as smooth as possible.</p><h2 id="clojure&#95;data&#95;cookbook">Clojure Data Cookbook</h2><p>This month I added a chapter about working with data from databases, starting with SQL, and also continued to work on the end-to-end example for the introductory section. Working with real data is very difficult and interesting, and it's a fun challenge to try to figure out the right balance between getting into the weeds and compromising on the final result. So much of data science is just cleaning up messy data from the world, but surprisingly often you have to make some assumptions about how you're going to use the data in order to make decisions about how to do the cleaning. And there are tons of different ways to "clean" data, but the strategies you use depend on what information you're after.</p><p>In the particular example of the housing dataset I'm working with there are many missing values to handle, and some questionable rows that look like duplicates but aren't <i>exactly</i> duplicates. There are also lots of illogical data points, like house sales from the future or multiple sales for the same property on a given date. Deciding how to handle these cases to build up a "clean" dataset to actually work with is a very interesting exercise in domain modelling and goal setting.</p><h2 id="scicloj&#95;mentoring&#95;program">Scicloj mentoring program</h2><p>This one is really mostly Daniel Slutsky's amazing work, but we collaborated on launching it and it's definitely worth mentioning. We put together a <a href='https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/open-source-mentoring/'>structured way for people to get involved</a> in contributing to Clojure's open source data science ecosystem, and got an overwhelmingly positive response. Over 25 people reached out to express an interest in contributing their time to Scicloj projects. The structured parts of the program include having some help choosing a meaningful and impactful project to work on, and up to an hour per week of one-on-one time with a mentor to help things progress. Daniel is doing all the heavy lifting coordinating the mentors, but it's been great so far participating as one and meeting some very keen and smart people who are willing to help us move things forward.</p><p>Another big part of this is thinking of the projects to work on. We came up with a list of projects that would deliver high value to the community but remain small enough to tackle by a single developer. We also tried to come up with ones that would require a wide range of skills and interests to try to accommodate as many people as possible. I am super excited to see how things go over the next few months with all of these projects.</p><h2 id="other&#95;community&#95;connections">Other community connections</h2><p>I'm still doing my weekly data-science drop-in streaming with Clojure Camp. I really enjoy connecting with other people who are interested in Clojure for data science, and I often get great suggestions and tips, too.</p><p>I also met with a couple of groups of people who are presenting at the Conj this year to help brainstorm some ideas for how to make the most of the talks. Daniel has amazing vision for the community and organized these calls that I was lucky enough to join. The goal is to connect all of the people who are giving data-related talks to optimize the overall messaging, like minimizing duplication across talks or drawing examples from each other's presentations. I love conference speaking and hope to do more of it in future years when my personal commitments allow for it, but in the meantime it's really amazing getting to connect with such cool people in the community to learn about their talks and brainstorm ideas for making them the best they can be. I'm hoping to attend the conference this year to see some of these great talks in person.</p><h2 id="personal&#95;updates">Personal Updates</h2><p>This has been a really amazing year professionally, having had the opportunity to spend much more time than in the past on open source and public work for the Clojure community. I've been trying to make the most of it and it's been really rewarding. Over the next couple of months, there are some other parts of my life that will be taking precedence, however.</p><p>The main one is my relationship. I'm getting married in a couple of weeks and will be taking almost a month off between getting ready for the wedding, wrapping up all the loose ends afterward, and a nearly 3-week-long honeymoon. I've never taken this long off of work in my life, so I'm both excited and curious to see what it's like. For over a decade now my career has been taking up most of my time and energy. It's been well worth it and I'm really happy with my work now, but I'm also excited to be stepping into a new chapter of life where things can be more balanced.</p><p>Related to this, the other major update I have to share is that I've accepted a full time job with a company called BroadPeak which I will be starting as soon as I'm back from my honeymoon. It's a small fintech company built primarily with Clojure that handles trade data management, commodities transaction surveillance, regulatory compliance, and other things related to the behind-the-scenes of commodities trading. I think it's a perfect fit for my skills and interests, and I'm hoping to have a chance to build some bridges between a really exciting, growing company that uses Clojure for real-world financial data processing and the Clojure open source community. Initial conversations about how the engineering team there feels about open source and community involvement have been really promising, so I'm optimistic that it will work out well for everyone. I'm not sure yet what exactly my open source work will look like once this job starts, but at a minimum I will still be working on the various side projects, like I always was before I tried giving it a go full time.</p><p>No matter how things go, I'll be back in two more months with another update. Thanks for reading. As always, feel free to reach out, and hopefully see some of you at the Conj! :)</p>

        <h1><a href="2024-07-18-tablecloth-dplyr-pandas-polars.html">Data Manipulation in Clojure Compared to R and Python</a></h1>
        <p>I spend a lot of time developing and teaching people about Clojure's open source tools for working with data. Almost everybody who wants to use Clojure for this kind of work is coming from another language ecosystem, usually R or Python. Together with Daniel Slutsky, I'm working on formalizing some of the common teachings into a course. Part of that is providing context for people coming from other ecosystems, including "translations" of how to accomplish data science tasks in Clojure.</p><p>As part of this development, I wanted to share an early preview in this blog post. The format is inspired by this great blog post I read a while ago comparing <a href='https://krz.github.io/Comparing-dplyr-with-polars/'>R and Polars</a> side by side (where "R" here refers to <a href='https://www.tidyverse.org'>the tidyverse</a>, an opinionated collection of R libraries for data science, and realistically mostly <a href='https://dplyr.tidyverse.org'><code>dplyr</code></a> specifically). I'm adding Pandas because it's among the most popular dataset manipulation libraries, and of course Clojure, specifically <a href='https://github.com/scicloj/tablecloth'>tablecloth</a>, the primary data manipulation library in our ecosystem.</p><p>I'll use the same dataset as the original blog post, the <a href='https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html'>Palmer Penguin dataset</a>. For the sake of simplicity, I saved a copy of the dataset as a CSV file and made it available on this website. I will also refer the data as a "dataset" throughout this post because that's what Clojure people call a tabular, column-major data structure, but it's the same thing that is variously referred to as a dataframe, data table, or just "data" in other languages. I'm also assuming you know how to install the packages required in the given ecosystems, but any necessary imports or requirements are included in the code snippets the first time they appear. Versions of all languages and libraries used in this post are listed at the end. Here we go!</p><h2 id="reading&#95;data">Reading data</h2><p>Reading data is straightforward in every language, but as a bonus we want to be able to indicate on the fly which values should be interpreted as "missing", whatever that means in the given libraries. In this dataset, the string <code>&quot;NA&quot;</code> means "missing", so we want to tell the dataset constructor this as soon as possible. Here's the comparison of how to accomplish that in various languages:</p><h3 id="tablecloth">Tablecloth</h3><pre><code class="lang-clojure">&#40;require '&#91;tablecloth.api :as tc&#93;&#41;

&#40;def ds 
  &#40;tc/dataset &quot;https://codewithkira.com/assets/penguins.csv&quot;&#41;&#41;
</code></pre><p>Note that tablecloth interprets the string "NA" as missing (<code>nil</code>, in Clojure) by default.</p><h3 id="r">R</h3><p>In reality, in R you would get the dataset from the R <a href='https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html'>package that contains the dataset</a>. This is a fairly common practice in R. In order to compare apples to apples, though, here I'll show how to initialize the dataset from a remote CSV file, using the <a href='https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html'><code>readr</code> package's <code>read&#95;csv</code></a>, which is part of the tidyverse:</p><pre><code class="lang-r">library&#40;tidyverse&#41;

ds &lt;- read&#95;csv&#40;&quot;https://codewithkira.com/assets/penguins.csv&quot;,
               na = &quot;NA&quot;&#41;
</code></pre><h3 id="pandas">Pandas</h3><pre><code class="lang-python">import pandas as pd

ds = pd.read&#95;csv&#40;&quot;https://codewithkira.com/assets/penguins.csv&quot;&#41;
</code></pre><p>Note that pandas has a <a href='https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html'>fairly long list</a> of values it considers <code>NaN</code> already, so we don't need to specify what missing values look like in our case, since <code>&quot;NA&quot;</code> is already in that list.</p><h3 id="polars">Polars</h3><pre><code class="lang-python">import polars as pl

ds = pl.read&#95;csv&#40;&quot;https://codewithkira.com/assets/penguins.csv&quot;,
                 null&#95;values=&quot;NA&quot;&#41;
</code></pre><h2 id="basic&#95;commands&#95;to&#95;explore&#95;the&#95;dataset">Basic commands to explore the dataset</h2><p>The first thing people usually want to do with their dataset is see it and poke around a bit. Below is a comparison of how to accomplish basic data exploration tasks using each library.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Operation</th><th>tablecloth</th><th>dplyr</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>see first 10 rows</td><td><code>&#40;tc/head ds 10&#41;</code></td><td><code>head&#40;ds, 10&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>see all column names</td><td><code>&#40;tc/column-names ds&#41;</code></td><td><code>colnames&#40;ds&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>select column</td><td><code>&#40;tc/select-columns ds &quot;year&quot;&#41;</code></td><td><code>select&#40;ds, year&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>select multiple columns</td><td><code>&#40;tc/select-columns ds &#91;&quot;year&quot; &quot;sex&quot;&#93;&#41;</code></td><td><code>select&#40;ds, year, sex&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>select rows</td><td><code>&#40;tc/select-rows ds #&#40;&gt; &#40;% &quot;year&quot;&#41; 2008&#41;&#41;</code></td><td><code>filter&#40;ds, year &gt; 2008&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>sort column</td><td><code>&#40;tc/order-by ds &quot;year&quot;&#41;</code></td><td><code>arrange&#40;ds, year&#41;</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><table><thead><tr><th>Operation</th><th>pandas</th><th>polars</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>see first <code>n</code> rows</td><td><code>ds.head&#40;10&#41;</code></td><td><code>ds.head&#40;10&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>see all column names</td><td><code>ds.columns</code></td><td><code>ds.columns</code></td></tr><tr><td>select column</td><td><code>ds&#91;&#91;&quot;year&quot;&#93;&#93;</code></td><td><code>ds.select&#40;pl.col&#40;&quot;year&quot;&#41;&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>select multiple columns</td><td><code>ds&#91;&#91;&quot;year&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;&#93;&#93;</code></td><td><code>ds.select&#40;pl.col&#40;&quot;year&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;&#41;&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>select rows</td><td><code>ds&#91;ds&#91;&quot;year&quot;&#93; &gt; 2008&#93;</code></td><td><code>ds.filter&#40;pl.col&#40;&quot;year&quot;&#41; &gt; 2008&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>sort column</td><td><code>ds.sort&#95;values&#40;&quot;year&quot;&#41;</code></td><td><code>ds.sort&#40;&quot;year&quot;&#41;</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Note there are some differences in how different libraries sort missing values, for example in tablecloth and polars they are placed at the beginning (so they're at the top when a column is sorted in ascending order and last when descending), but dplyr and pandas place them last (regardless of whether ascending or descending order is specified).</p><p>As you can see, these commands are all pretty similar, with the exception of selecting rows in tablecloth. This is a short-hand syntax for writing an anonymous function in Clojure, which is how rows are selected. Being a functional language, functions in Clojure are "first-class", which basically just means they are passed around as arguments willy-nilly, all over the place, all the time. In this case, the third argument to tablecloth's <code>select-rows</code> function is a predicate (a function that returns a boolean) that takes as its argument a dataset row as a map of column names to values. Don't worry, though, tablecloth doesn't process your entire dataset row-wise. Under the hood datasets are highly optimized to perform column-wise operations as fast as possible.</p><p>Here's an example of what it looks like to string a couple of these basic dataset exploration operations together, for example in this case to get the <code>bill&#95;length&#95;mm</code> of all penguins with <code>body&#95;mass&#95;g</code> below 3800:</p><h3 id="tablecloth">Tablecloth</h3><pre><code class="lang-clojure">&#40;-&gt; ds
    &#40;tc/select-rows #&#40;and &#40;% &quot;body&#95;mass&#95;g&quot;&#41;
                          &#40;&gt; &#40;% &quot;body&#95;mass&#95;g&quot;&#41; 3800&#41;&#41;&#41;
    &#40;tc/select-columns &quot;bill&#95;length&#95;mm&quot;&#41;&#41;
</code></pre><p>Note that in tablecloth we have to explicitly omit rows where the value we're filtering by is missing, unlike in other libraries. This is because tablecloth actually uses <code>nil</code> (as opposed to a library-specific construct) to indicate a missing value , and in Clojure <code>nil</code> is not treated as comparable to numbers. If we were to try to compare <code>nil</code> to a number, we would get an exception telling us that we're trying to compare incomparable types. Clojure is fundamentally dynamically typed in that it only does type checking at runtime and bindings can refer to values of any type, but it is also strongly typed, as we see here, in the sense that it explicitly avoids implicit type coercion. For example deciding whether 0 is greater or larger than <code>nil</code> requires some assumptions, and these are intentionally not baked into the core of Clojure or into tablecloth as a library as is the case in some other languages and libraries.</p><p>This example also introduces Clojure's "thread-first" macro. The <code>-&gt;</code> arrow is like R's <code>|&gt;</code> operator or the unix pipe, effectively passing the output of each function in the chain as input to the next. It comes in very handy for data processing code like this.</p><p>Here is the equivalent operation in the other libraries:</p><h3 id="dplyr">dplyr</h3><pre><code class="lang-r">ds |&gt;
    filter&#40;body&#95;mass&#95;g &lt; 3800&#41; |&gt;
    select&#40;bill&#95;length&#95;mm&#41;
</code></pre><h3 id="pandas">Pandas</h3><pre><code class="lang-python">ds&#91;ds&#91;&quot;body&#95;mass&#95;g&quot;&#93; &lt; 3800&#93;&#91;&quot;bill&#95;length&#95;mm&quot;&#93;
</code></pre><h3 id="polars">Polars</h3><pre><code class="lang-python">ds.filter&#40;pl.col&#40;&quot;body&#95;mass&#95;g&quot;&#41; &lt; 3800&#41;.select&#40;pl.col&#40;&quot;bill&#95;length&#95;mm&quot;&#41;&#41;
</code></pre><h2 id="more&#95;advanced&#95;filtering&#95;and&#95;selecting">More advanced filtering and selecting</h2><p>Here is what some more complicated data wrangling looks like across the libraries.</p><h3 id="select&#95;all&#95;columns&#95;except&#95;for&#95;one">Select all columns except for one</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Library</th><th>Code</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>tablecloth</td><td><code>&#40;tc/select-columns ds &#40;complement #{&quot;year&quot;}&#41;&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>dplyr</td><td><code>select&#40;ds, -year&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>pandas</td><td><code>ds.drop&#40;columns=&#91;&quot;year&quot;&#93;&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>polars</td><td><code>ds.select&#40;pl.exclude&#40;&quot;year&quot;&#41;&#41;</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Another property of functional languages in general, and especially Clojure, is that they really take advantage of the fact that a lot of things are functions that you might not be used to treating like functions. They also leverage function composition to simply combine multiple functions into a single operation.</p><p>For example a set (indicated with the <code>#{}</code> syntax in Clojure) is a special function that returns a boolean indicating whether the given argument is a member of the set or not. And <a href='https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/complement'><code>complement</code></a> is a function in <code>clojure.core</code> that effectively inverts the function given to it, so combined <code>&#40;complement #{&quot;year&quot;}&#41;</code> means "every value that is <i>not</i> in the set <code>#{&quot;year&quot;}</code>, which we can then use as our predicate column selector function to filter out certain columns.</p><h3 id="select&#95;all&#95;columns&#95;that&#95;start&#95;with&#95;a&#95;given&#95;string">Select all columns that start with a given string</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Library</th><th>Code</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>tablecloth</td><td><code>&#40;tc/select-columns ds #&#40;str/starts-with? % &quot;bill&quot;&#41;&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>dplyr</td><td><code>select&#40;ds, starts&#95;with&#40;&quot;bill&quot;&#41;&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>pandas</td><td><code>ds.filter&#40;regex=&quot;&#94;bill&quot;&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>polars</td><td><pre style="width:max-content"><code>import polars.selectors as cs</code><br><code>ds.select(cs.starts_with("bill"))</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="select&#95;only&#95;numeric&#95;columns">Select only numeric columns</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Library</th><th>Code</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>tablecloth</td><td><code>&#40;tc/select-columns ds :type/numerical&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>dplyr</td><td><code>select&#40;ds, where&#40;is.numeric&#41;&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>pandas</td><td><code>ds.select&#95;dtypes&#40;include='number'&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>polars</td><td><code>ds.select&#40;cs.numeric&#40;&#41;&#41;</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The symbol <code>:type/numerical</code> in Clojure here is a magic keyword that tablecloth knows about and can accept as a column selector.

Here's how you'd generate a new column based on the values in some other columns in each library:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Library</th><th>Code</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>tablecloth</td><td><pre style="width:max-content"><code>(require '[tablecloth.column.api :as tcc])<br>(tc/add-columns ds {"ratio" (tcc// (ds "bill&#95;length&#95;mm")<br>                                   (ds "flipper&#95;length&#95;mm"))})</code></pre></td></tr><tr><td>dplyr</td><td><code>mutate&#40;ds, ratio = bill&#95;length&#95;mm / flipper&#95;length&#95;mm&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>pandas</td><td><code>ds&#91;&quot;ratio&quot;&#93; = ds&#91;&quot;bill&#95;length&#95;mm&quot;&#93; / ds&#91;&quot;flipper&#95;length&#95;mm&quot;&#93;</code></td></tr><tr><td>polars</td><td><pre style="width:max-content"><code>ds.with&#95;columns(<br>    (pl.col("bill&#95;length&#95;mm") /<br>     pl.col("flipper&#95;length&#95;mm")).alias("ratio")<br>)</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Note that this is where the wheels start to come off if you're not working in a functional way with immutable data structures. Clojure data structures (including tablecloth datasets) are immutable, which is not the case Pandas. The Pandas code above mutates the dataset in place, so as soon as you do any mutating operations like these, you now have to keep mental track of the state of your dataset, which can quickly lead to high cognitive overhead and lots of incidental complexity.</p><h3 id="renaming&#95;columns">Renaming columns</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Library</th><th>Code</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>tablecloth</td><td><code>&#40;tc/rename-columns ds {&quot;bill&#95;length&#95;mm&quot; &quot;bill&#95;length&quot;}&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>dplyr</td><td><code>rename&#40;ds, bill&#95;length = bill&#95;length&#95;mm&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>pandas</td><td><code>ds.rename&#40;columns={&quot;bill&#95;length&#95;mm&quot;: &quot;bill&#95;length&quot;}&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>polars</td><td><code>ds.rename&#40;{&quot;bill&#95;length&#95;mm&quot;: &quot;bill&#95;length&quot;}&#41;</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Again beware, the Pandas implementation shown here mutates the dataset in place. Also manually specifying every column name transformation you want to do is one way to accomplish the task, but sometimes that can be tedious if you want to apply the same transformation to every column name, which is fairly common.</p><h3 id="transforming&#95;column&#95;names">Transforming column names</h3><p>Here's how you would upper case all column names:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Library</th><th>Code</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>tablecloth</td><td><code>&#40;tc/rename-columns ds :all str/upper-case&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>dplyr</td><td><code>rename&#95;with&#40;ds, toupper&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>pandas</td><td><code>ds.columns = ds.columns.str.upper&#40;&#41;</code></td></tr><tr><td>polars</td><td><code>ds.select&#40;pl.all&#40;&#41;.name.to&#95;uppercase&#40;&#41;&#41;</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Like the other libraries, tablecloth's <code>rename-columns</code> accepts both types of arguments &ndash; a simple mapping of old -> new column names, or any column selector and any transformation function. For example, removing the units from each column name would look like this in each language:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Library</th><th>Code</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>tablecloth</td><td><code>(tc/rename-columns ds #".+&#95;(mm&#124;g)" #(str/replace % #"(.+)&#95;(mm&#124;g)" "$1"))</code></td></tr><tr><td>dplyr</td><td><code>rename&#95;with(penguins, ~ str&#95;replace(.x, "&#94;(.+)&#95;(mm&#124;g)$", "&#92;1"))</code></td></tr><tr><td>pandas</td><td><pre style="width:max-content"><code>import re<br>ds.rename(columns=lambda x: re.sub(r"(.+)_(mm&#124;g)$", r"\1", x))</code></pre></td></tr><tr><td>polars</td><td><pre style="width:max-content"><code>ds = ds.rename({<br>    col: col.replace("&#95;mm", "").replace("&#95;g", "")<br>    for col in ds.columns<br>})</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="grouping&#95;and&#95;aggregating">Grouping and aggregating</h2><p>Grouping behaves <a href='https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/index.html#group-by'>somewhat unconventionally in tablecloth</a>. Datasets can be grouped by a single column name or a sequence of column names like in other libraries, but grouping can also be done using any arbitrary function. Grouping in tablecloth also returns a new dataset, similar to dplyr, rather than an abstract intermediate object (as in pandas and polars). Grouped datasets have three columns, (name of the group, group id, and a column containing a new dataset of the grouped data). Once a dataset is grouped, the group values can be aggregated in a variety of ways.

        <p>This is a summary of the open source work I've spent my time on throughout May and June, 2024. There were lots of small bug fixes and reports, driven by work on the Clojure Data Cookbook. This work was also the impetus for my initial release of <a href='https://github.com/scicloj/tcutils'><code>tcutils</code></a>, a library of utility functions for working with tablecloth datasets. I also had the wonderful opportunity to attend PyData London in June and found it really insightful and inspiring. Read on for more details.</p><h2 id="sponsors">Sponsors</h2><p>This work is made possible by the generous ongoing support of my sponsors. I appreciate all of the support the community has given to my work and would like to give a special thanks to Clojurists Together and Nubank for providing me with lucrative enough grants that I can reduce my client work significantly and afford to spend more time on these projects.</p><p>If you find my work valuable, please share it with others and consider supporting it financially. There are details about how to do that on my <a href='https://github.com/sponsors/kiramclean'>GitHub sponsors page</a>. On to the updates!</p><h2 id="ecosystem&#95;issue&#95;reports&#95;and&#95;bug&#95;fixes">Ecosystem issue reports and bug fixes</h2><p>Working on the cookbook these last couple of months turned up a few small issues in ecosystem libraries. The other developers of Clojure's data science tools are such a pleasure to work with, it's so rare and nice to have a distributed team of people capable of getting cool things built asynchronously. Here are some details of a few particular issues that came up:</p><ul><li>Small problem loading .xls/.xlsx files as datasets if they had a number as a column name: <a href='https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/236259-tech.2Eml.2Edataset.2Edev/topic/xlsx.20column.20parsing/near/437313810'>discussed here</a>, <a href='https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset/issues/408'>reported here</a>, and graciously <a href='https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset/commit/24c0e646f289210aa95c1ac9998cb2ddd5c9f836'>fixed by Chris Nuernberger</a>.</li><li>Unexpected behaviour when comparing certain numeric types in <code>dtype-next</code>: <a href='https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/236259-tech.2Eml.2Edataset.2Edev/topic/numeric.20datatypes/near/438617694%5D(https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/%23narrow/stream/236259-tech.2Eml.2Edataset.2Edev/topic/numeric.20datatypes/near/438617694'>discussed here</a>, <a href='https://github.com/cnuernber/dtype-next/issues/99'>reported here</a>, and again <a href='https://github.com/cnuernber/dtype-next/commit/563fe9c13797feb206391cd951655942e3e6cf0f'>fixed by Chris</a>.

I wanted to start bringing some of these convenience utilities to Clojure, so for now I'm putting them in <a href='https://github.com/scicloj/tcutils'><code>tcutils</code></a>. So far only a handful of helpers are implemented (<code>lag</code>, <code>lead</code>, <code>cumsum</code>, and <code>clean-column-names</code>). The goal is to eventually fill out more utilities that save people from having to dig into the documentation of half a dozen different libraries to figure out how to implement things like these. The goal is not to achieve feature parity or to exactly copy similar libraries, like pandas or dplyr, but rather to take inspiration from them and make our tools easier to use for people who are used to these conveniences.</p><h2 id="progress&#95;on&#95;clojure&#95;data&#95;cookbook">Progress on Clojure Data Cookbook</h2><p>I spent a lot of time on the Clojure Data Cookbook over these last two months. Notable progress includes:</p><ul><li>The introductory chapters bear some resemblance now to the final form they'll take.</li><li>The overall structure of the book is much more clear now.</li><li>I started the example analysis that will serve as the high-level introductory section of the book.</li><li>The publishing and deployment process is finally working.</li></ul><p>It's still very much in progress, but in the interest of transparency the work-in-progress version is <a href='https://github.com/scicloj/clojure-data-cookbook'>available online now</a>. It will continue to evolve and change as I fill out more and more of the chapters, but there's enough of it available now to hopefully give a sense of the style and tone I'm going for. I also finally have the publishing workflow set up and it's generating a nice-looking Quarto book, thanks to all of Daniel Slutsky's amazing work on Clay and Quarto integration recently.</p><h2 id="progress&#95;on&#95;high-level&#95;goals">Progress on high-level goals</h2><p>The high-level goal of my work in general remains to steward Clojure's data science ecosystem to a state of maturity and flourishing so that data practitioners can use it to get real work done. Toward this end, I set up a <a href='https://github.com/users/kiramclean/projects/4'>project board</a> to track progress toward what I see as the main components of this project. </p><p>Over the last couple of months, beginning with a prototype demoed at my <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUFf3-og_-Y'>London Clojurians talk in April</a>, Daniel Slutsky has made tremendous progress on our goal of implementing a grammar of graphics in Clojure in the new <a href='https://github.com/scicloj/hanamicloth'>hanamicloth library</a>. The near-term goal is to stabilize the API of this library enough that it can be used to provide a user-friendly way to accomplish all of the simple data visualization tasks that are currently possible with our other tools. The long term goal is to take the lessons we learn from this library and build a JVM-only grammar of graphics library for doing data visualization "right" in Clojure.</p><p>The development and surrounding discussions of hanamicloth have also made me realize it would be useful to write an overview of the current state of dataviz options for Clojure and why we're working on building something new. That's on my list for the coming months, but lower priority than actual development work.</p><h2 id="impressions&#95;from&#95;pydata&#95;london">Impressions from PyData London</h2><p>I got to attend PyData London this year thanks to a client of mine who was sponsoring the conference. I learned a lot and found the talks very interesting. My overall impression is that data science is maturing as a discipline, with more polished methods and robust theory backing up different approaches to data-related problems. With this maturation, though, comes higher expectations for production-ready, professional quality results. Most of the talks focused on high-level concerns like observability, scalability, and long-term stewardship of large open-source projects.</p><p>There are a lot of reasons why Python is just not ideal for building highly available, high-performance systems, and I really believe this is a good time to be building alternative tools for data science. Python is obviously entrenched as the current default language for working with data, but it is difficult and slow to write code that can take full advantage of modern hardware (because of the infamous global interpreter lock, reference counting, slow I/O, among other reasons). And to be fair, the Python community knows this. It's why virtually all of the libraries that do the heavy lifting for data science in Python are actually implemented in C (numpy,  pandas) or Rust (Polars, Pydantic), or are wrappers around C++ (PyTorch, TensorFlow, matplotlib) or Java (PySpark, Pydoop, confluent-kafka) libraries. </p><p>I think this provides a lot of insights into what data practitioners want. It's clear that users <i>want</i> approachable, simple, human-readable interfaces for all of these tools, and that any new tool needs to interoperate with the rest of the ones currently in use. People are also <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40815097'>tired of churn</a> and are craving stability. I think Clojure has a lot to offer in all of these areas and is well placed to become more widely adopted for data science.</p><h2 id="ongoing&#95;work">Ongoing work</h2><p>My focus over the next two months will remain on the cookbook. My main goal is to finish the introductory chapter with the housing price analysis and to continue putting together the data import section with instructions and examples for all file formats that can reasonably be supported easily at this time.</p><p>I'll continue to support and contribute to all of the ecosystem libraries I come across in my writings and analysis work in hopes of smoothing out all the rough edges I find.</p><p>Thanks for reading. I always love hearing from people who are interested in any of the things I'm working on. If that's you, don't hesitate to be in touch :)</p>
